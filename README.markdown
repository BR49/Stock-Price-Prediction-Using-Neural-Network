# Analyzing Stock Price Using Artificial Neural Networks

 **CHAPTER 1**

**INTRODUCTION**

> A correct prediction of stocks can lead to huge profits for the seller
> and the broker. Frequently, it is brought out that prediction is
> chaotic rather than random, which means it can be predicted by
> carefully analyzing the history of respective stock market. Machine
> learning is an efficient way to represent such processes. It predicts
> a market value close to the tangible value, thereby increasing the
> accuracy. Introduction of machine learning to the area of stock
> prediction has appealed to many researches because of its efficient
> and accurate measurements. The vital part of machine learning is the
> dataset used. The dataset should be as concrete as possible because a
> little change in the data can perpetuate massive changes in the
> outcome.
>
> The price of the stocks is an important indicator for a company and
> many factors can affect their values. Different events may affect
> public sentiments and emotions differently, which may have an effect
> on the trend of stock market prices. Because of dependency on various
> factors, the stock prices are not static, but are instead dynamic,
> highly noisy and nonlinear time series data. Due to its great learning
> capability for solving the nonlinear time series prediction problems,
> machine learning has been applied to this research area.
> Learning-based methods for stock price prediction are very popular and
> a lot of enhanced strategies have been used to improve the performance
> of the learning based predictors. However, performing successful stock
> market prediction is still a challenge.
>
> Stock market analysis is a widely studied problem as it offers
> practical applications for signal processing and predictive methods
> and a tangible financial reward. Creating a system that yields
> consistent returns is extremely challenging and is currently an open
> problem as stock market prices are extremely volatile and vary widely
> both within a given stock and comparatively amongst many stocks.
> Further, stock market data is influenced by a large number of factors
> including foreign and domestic economies, trade agreements, wars,
> seasons, and even day of the week.


>
> **1.1Problem Statement**
>
> These days the financial exchange has gotten extremely famous,
> everyone needs to purchase an offer at an organization and on the off
> chance that they could transform that share into benefit it would be
> useful for them, however the forecast of stocks cost is an
> exceptionally dreary and incomprehensible occupation for a solitary
> individual. So we present our stock price prediction system.

> **2.3 FEASIBILITY STUDY**
>
> The feasibility study proposes one or more feasible conceptual
> solutions to the problem set of the project. The conceptual solutions
> give an idea of what the new system will Look like. They indicate what
> inputs are needed by the system and what outputs will be produced.
> Three things to be done to established feasibility. First, it must be
> checked that the project is technically feasible. Second, operational
> feasibility must be established. For this, it is necessary to consult
> the system users to see if the proposed solution satisfies user
> objectives and can be fitted in to current system operation. Third,
> economic feasibility must be checked. The study must determine
>
> whether the project's goal can be achieved within the resource limits
> allocated to it. It must also determine whether it is worthwhile to
> proceed with the project at all or whether the benefits obtained from
> the new system are not worth the cost, in which case the project will
> be terminated.

>
> Feasibility study is necessary to determine whether the proposed
> system is feasible considering the technical, operational and economic
> factors. By having detailed feasibility study one can have a clear
> view of the proposed system with respect to its benefits and draw
> backs.
>
> For a successful feasibility study of system feasibility, the existing
> systems and proposed system are studied carefully.
>
> **2.3.1 TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY**
>
> Technical feasibility is the study of resource availability that may
> affect the ability to achieve an acceptable system. Technical
> feasibility is the most difficult area to ensure at initial stages.
> Since the objectives functions and performance cannot be predicted to
> its fullest, everything seems possible provided proper assumptions are
> made. It is essential that the process of technical feasibility. The
> consideration that is normally associated with technical feasibility
> included resource availability at the organization where the project
> is to be developed and implemented.
>
> **2.3.2 ECONOMIC FESIBILITY**
>
> An evaluation of development cast weighted against the ultimate income
> or benefit derived from the developed system. Economical economic
> justification includes a broad range of concerns that include
> cost-benefit analysis. Cost benefit delineates costs for project
> development and weighs them against tangible and intangible benefits
> of a system. Regarding the cost and benefits, the project, which is to
> man-hours with compared to man that are required to record data about
> activity task report manually and also in terms of money benefits by
> the selling of this system as a product. Thus this project work is
> economically feasible for the development in any company. We have used
> open-source software's like python and pycharm to build our system
> Stock Price Prediction so cause of that the cost of project is very
> less and can be deployed without any economic issues.
>
> **2.3.3 OPERATIONAL FEASILBILITY**
>
> The project is going to be used by the organization under different
> circumstances. Anyone can work with this application as it supports
> user-friendly approach. It provides graphical user interfaces to the
> user, so that user can easily interact with the system. Our system


>
> Stock Price Prediction's UI is very user-friendly that user doesn't
> need knowledge about Python, HTML, CSS and Flask. The application is
> designed in such a way that it can be easily implemented in any
> version OS.
>
> **2.3.4 SCHEDULE FEASIBILITY**
>
> The time schedule required for the development of this project is 5
> months and it is very important since over-runs result in escalated
> projects costs and also hinders in the development of the other
> systems.

> **SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION**
>
> Software Requirement Specification (SRS) is essential information,
> which shapes the establishment of the software development process.
> SRS records the necessities of a framework as well as has a depiction
> of its significant components.
>
> The focus in this stage is one of the users of the system and not the
> system solutions. The result of the requirement specification document
> states the intention of the software, properties and constraints of
> the desired system. SRS constitutes the understanding amongst
> customers and designers with respect to the substance of the product
> that will be created. SRS should be precise and totally signify the
> framework prerequisites as it makes a colossal commitme2nt to the
> general development plan.
>
> One of the most essential information is SRS(Software Requirement
> Specification). It gives the detailed information about establishment
> of software development process. It records the important necessities
> of the frame work also holds the depiction of the important
> components. These things will be in the IEEE standards. The
> recommendations would shape the explanation behind giving clear image
> of the item to be made filling in as measure for execution of an
> understanding among client and the developer. One of the important
> steps involved in the development process is system requirements. This
> SRS(Software Requirement Specification) is followed after resource
> analysis phase. Its main task is to decide what a software product
> does. In this stage the main focus is the user, and not the system
> solution. SRS(Software Requirement Specification) gives the results
> like intention of the software, properties and constraints of the
> desired system. The main advantage of SRS(Software Requirement
> Specification) is that it gives a clear understanding among the
> clients and the product developers with respect to the product that is
> developed. SRS(Software Requirement Specification) which is documented
> should accurate and the prerequisites of the frame work should be
> signified as it makes colossal commitment to the general development
> plan process.

> Spiral model is one of the most important Software Development Life
> Cycle models, which provides support for Risk Handling. In its
> diagrammatic representation, it looks like a spiral with many loops.
> The exact number of loops of the spiral is unknown and can vary from
> project to project. Each loop of the spiral is called a Phase of the
> software development process. The exact number of phases needed to
> develop the product can be varied by the project manager depending
> upon the project risks. As the project manager dynamically determines
> the number of phases, so the project manager has an important role to
> develop a product using spiral model.
>
> The Radius of the spiral at any point represents the expenses(cost) of
> the project so far, and the angular dimension represents the progress
> made so far in the current phase.

**Fig 3.1:** Spiral Model


>
> Each phase of Spiral Model is divided into four quadrants as shown in
> the above figure. The functions of these four quadrants are discussed
> below-
>
> 1.Objectives determination and identify alternative solutions:
> Requirements are gathered from the customers and the objectives are
> identified, elaborated and analyzed at the start of every phase. Then
> alternative solutions possible for the phase are proposed in this
> quadrant.
>
> 2.Identify and resolve Risks: During the second quadrant all the
> possible solutions are evaluated to select the best possible solution.
> Then the risks associated with that solution is identified and the
> risks are resolved using the best possible strategy. At the end of
> this quadrant, Prototype is built for the best possible solution.
>
> 3.Develop next version of the Product: During the third quadrant, the
> identified features are developed and verified through testing. At the
> end of the third quadrant, the next version of the software is
> available.
>
> 4.Review and plan for the next Phase: In the fourth quadrant, the
> Customers evaluate the so far developed version of the software. In
> the end, planning for the next phase is started.
>
> **Risk Handling in Spiral Model**\
> A risk is any adverse situation that might affect the successful
> completion of a software project. The most important feature of the
> spiral model is handling these unknown risks after the project has
> started. Such risk resolutions are easier done by developing a
> prototype. The spiral model supports coping up with risks by providing
> the scope to build a prototype at every phase of the software
> development.
>
> Prototyping Model also support risk handling, but the risks must be
> identified completely before the start of the development work of the
> project. But in real life project risk may occur after the development
> work starts, in that case, we cannot use Prototyping Model. In each
> phase of the Spiral Model, the features of the product dated and
> analyzed and the risks at that point of time are identified and are
> resolved through prototyping. Thus, this model is much more flexible
> compared to other PDLC models.


>
> **Why Spiral Model is called Meta Model?**
>
> The Spiral model is called as a Meta Model because it subsumes all the
> other SDLC models. For example, a single loop spiral actually
> represents the The spiral model incorporates the stepwise approach of
> thepiral model uses the approach of Prototyping Model by buildin each
> phase as a risk handling technique. Also, the spiral model can be
> considered as supporting the evolutionary model -- the iterations
> along the spiral can be considered as evolutionary levels through
> which the complete system is built.
>
> Advantages of Spiral Model: Below are some of the advantages of the
> Spiral Model.
>
> • Risk Handling: The projects with many unknown risks that occur as
> the development proceeds, in that case, Spiral Model is the best
> development model to follow due to the risk analysis and risk handling
> at every phase.
>
> • Good for large projects: It is recommended to use the Spiral Model
> in large and complex projects.
>
> • Flexibility in Requirements: Change requests in the Requirements at
> later phase can be incorporated accurately by using this model.
>
> • Customer Satisfaction: Customer can see the development of the
> product at the early phase of the software development and thus, they
> habituated with the system by using it before completion of the total
> product.

> Disadvantages of Spiral Model: Below are some of the main
> disadvantages of the spiral model complex:

> **3.5 Tools and Technologies used**
>
> **3.5.1 Overview of python**
>
> Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming
> language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991,
> Python\'s design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its
> notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and
> object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical
> code for small and large-scale projects.
>
> Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports
> multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented,
> and functional programming. Python is often described as a \"batteries
> included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.


>
> Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC
> language. Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features like list
> comprehensions and a garbage collection system capable of collecting
> reference cycles. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision
> of the language that is not completely backward-compatible, and much
> Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.The Python 2
> language, i.e. Python 2.7.x, was officially discontinued on January 1,
> 2020 (first planned for 2015) after which security patches and other
> improvements will not be released for it. With Python 2\'s
> end-of-life, only Python 3.5.x and later are supported.
>
> Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. A global
> community of programmers develops and maintains Python, an open source
> reference implementation. A non-profit organization, the Python
> Software Foundation, manages and directs resources for Python and
> Python development.
>
> **Pandas**
>
> Pandas is an open source Python package that is most widely used for
> data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks. It is built on
> top of another package named which provides support for
> multi-dimensional arrays. As one of the most popular dgling packages,
> Pandas works well with many other modules inside the Python ecosystem,
> and is typically included in every Python dim those that come with
> your operating system to commercial vendor distributions like
> ActiveState's

**SYSTEM ANALYSIS**

> **4.1 Architecture**
>
> Three-tier (layer) is a client-server architecture in which the user
> interface, business process (business rules) and data storage and data
> access are developed and maintained as independent modules or most
> often on separate platforms.
>
> The Architecture of Application is based on three-tier architecture.
> The three logical tiers are:
>
> •Presentation tier - HTML Forms, Images.
>
> •Middle tier -- Python classes.
>
> •Data tier- SQL\
> The main reason for considering three-tier architecture for the
> Application is as follows:
>
> **4.1.1 Flexibility:**
>
> • Management of data is independent from the physical storage support,
>
> • Maintenance of the business logic is easier,\
> •Migration to new graphical environments is faster.
>
> •If there is a minor change in the business logic, we don't have to
> install the entire system
>
> in individual user's PCs.
>
> **4.1.2 Reusability:**
>
> •Reusability of business logic is greater for the presentation layer.
> As this component is developed and tested, we can use it in any other
> project and would be helpful for future use.
>
> **4.1.3 Security:**
>
> •More secured architecture since the client cannot access the database
> directly.


>
> **4.2 Three-Tier Architecture**
>
> A 3-tier architecture is a type of software architecture which is
> composed of three "tiers" or "layers" of logical computing. They are
> often used in applications as a specific type of client-server system.
> 3-tier architectures provide many benefits for production and
> development environments by modularizing the user interface, business
> logic, and data storage layers. Doing so gives greater flexibility to
> development teams by allowing them to update a specific part of an
> application independently of the other parts. This added flexibility
> can improve overall time-to-market and decrease development cycle
> times by giving development teams the ability to replace or upgrade
> independent tiers without affecting the other parts of the system.
>
> For example, the user interface of a web application could be
> redeveloped or modernized without affecting the underlying functional
> business and data access logic underneath. This architectural system
> is often ideal for embedding and integrating 3rd party software into
> an existing application. This integration flexibility also makes it
> ideal for embedding analytics software into pre-existing applications
> and is often used byvendors for this reason. 3-tier architectures are
> often used in cloud or on-preions as well as in software-as-a-service
> (SaaS) applications.
>
> **What Do the 3 Tiers Mean?**

**Fig 4.1:** Three tier architecture


>
> **4.2.1 Presentation tier**\
> The presentation tier is the front end layer in the 3-tier system and
> consists of the user interface. This user interface is often a
> graphical one accessible through a web browser or web-based
> application and which displays content and information useful to an
> end user. This tier is often built on web technologies such as HTML5,
> JavaScript, CSS, or through other popular web development frameworks,
> and communicates with others layers through API calls.
>
> **4.2.2 Middle tier**
>
> The Middle Tier or Business Logic layer consists of before delving
> further into the practical matters of application gaining a clear
> understanding of these concepts now will provide a sound foundation on
> which to build further knowledge.
>
> **4.2.3 Data tier**
>
> The Data Tier layer consists of database such as the data tier mainly
> concentrated on manipulating the data using a database management
> system. Here we implement the data tier using MYSQL. Different
> varieties of data base are Oracle, SQL.
>
> **4.2.4 Benefits of Using a 3-Layer Architecture**
>
> There are many benefits to using a 3-layer architecture including
> speed of development, scalability, performance, and availability. As
> mentioned, modularizing different tiers of an application gives
> development teams the ability to develop and enhance a product with
> greater speed than developing a singular code base because a specific
> layer can be upgraded with minimal impact on the other layers. It can
> also help improve development efficiency by allowing teams to focus on
> their core competencies. Many development teams have separate
> developers who specialize in front- end, server back-end, and data
> back-end development, by modularizing these parts of an application
> you no longer have to rely on full stack developers and can better
> utilize the specialties of each team.
>
> Scalability is another great advantage of a 3-layer architecture. By
> separating out the different layers you can scale each independently
> depending on the need at any given time. For


>
> example, if you are receiving many web requests but not many requests
> which affect your application layer, you can scale your web servers
> without touching your application servers. Similarly, if you are
> receiving many large application requests from only a handful of web
> users, you can scale out your application and data layers to meet
> those requests without touch your web servers. This allows you to load
> balance each layer independently, improving overall performance with
> minimal resources. Additionally, the independence created from
> modularizing the different tiers gives you many deployment options.
>
> By having disparate layers you can also increase reliability and
> availability by hosting different parts of your application on
> different servers and utilizing cached results. With a full stack
> system you have to worry about a server going down and greatly
> affecting performance throughout your entire system, but with a
> 3-layer application, the increased independence created when
> physically separating different parts of an application minimizes
> performance issues when a server goes down.
>
> **4.3 System perspective**
>
> Systems management is the combination of four key elements: processes,
> data, tools, and organization, which are all needed to manage a system
> efficiently and effectively. Processes deal with how to perform the
> task.

**SYSTEM DESIGN**

> Detailed design starts after the system design phase is completed and
> the system design has been certified through the review. The goal of
> this phase is to develop the internal logic of each of the modules
> identified during system design.
>
> In the system design, the focus is on identifying the modules, whereas
> during detailed design the focus is on designing the logic for the
> modules. In other words in system design attention is on what
> components are needed, while in detailed design how the components can
> be implemented in the software is the issue.
>
> The design activity is often divided into two separate phase system
> design and detailed design. System design is also called top-level
> design. At the first level focus is on deciding which modules are
> needed for the system, the specifications of these modules and how the
> modules should be interconnected. This is called system design or top
> level design. In the second level the internal design of the modules
> or how the specifications of the module can be satisfied is decided.
> This design level is often called detailed design or logic design.

**SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION**

> **6.1 Introduction**
>
> Implementation is the process of converting a new or a revised system
> design into an operational one. The objective is to put the new or
> revised system that has been tested into operation while holding
> costs, risks, and personal irritation to the minimum. A critical
> aspect of the implementation process is to ensure that there will be
> no disrupting the functioning of the organization. The best method for
> gaining control while implanting any new system would be to use well
> planned test for testing all new programs. Before production files are
> used to test live data, text files must be created on the old system,
> copied over to the new system, and used for the initial test of each
> program.
>
> Another factor to be considered in the implementation phase is the
> acquisition of the hardware and software. Once the software is
> developed for the system and testing is carried out, it is then the
> process of making the newly designed system fully operational and
> consistent in performance.
>
> Implementation is the most crucial stage in achieving a successful
> system and giving the user's confidence that the new system is
> workable and effective. This type of conversation is relatively easy
> to handle, provide there are no major changes in the system.
>
> **6.2 Parallel conversion type of implementation**
>
> In this type of implementation both the current system and the
> proposed system run in parallel. This happens till the user gets the
> complete confidence on the proposed system and hence cuts of the
> current system.
>
> **6.2.1 Phase - in method of implementation**
>
> In this type of implementation the proposed system is introduced
> phase-by-phase. This reduces the risk of uncertainty of proposed
> system.


>
> Each program is tested individually at the time of development using
> the data and has verified that this program linked together in the way
> specified in the programs specification, the computer system and its
> environment is tested to the satisfaction of the user. The system that
> has been developed is accepted and proved to be satisfactory for the
> user. And so the system is going to be implemented very soon. A simple
> operating procedure is included so that the user can understand the
> different functions clearly and quickly.
>
> Initially as a first step the executable form of the application is to
> be created and loaded in the common server machine which is accessible
> to the entire user and the server is to be connected to a network. The
> final stage is to document the entire system which provides components
> and the operating procedures of the system.
>
> Implementation is the stage of the project when the theoretical design
> is turned out into a working system. Thus it can be considered to be
> the most critical stage in achieving a successful new system and in
> giving the user, confidence that the new system will work and be
> effective.
>
> The implementation stage involves careful planning, investigation of
> the existing system
>
> and it's constraints on implementation, designing of methods to
> achieve changeover and evaluation of changeover methods.
>
> Implementation is the process of converting a new system design into
> operation. It is the phase that focuses on user training, site
> preparation and file conversion for installing a candidate system. The
> important factor that should be considered here is that the conversion
> should not disrupt the functioning of the organization.
>
> **6.3 Algorithms used in the system**
>
> **6.3.1 Linear Regression**
>
> Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised
> learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target
> prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for
> finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting.
> Different regression models differ based on -- the kind of
> relationship between dependent and



independent variables, they are considering and the number of
independent variables being

> used.
>
> Linear regression algorithm shows a linear relationship between a
> dependent (y) and one or more independent (y) variables, hence called
> as linear regression. Since linear regression shows the linear
> relationship, which means it finds how the value of the dependent
> variable is changing according to the value of the independent
> variable.
>
> **Linear Regression Analysis** consists of more than just fitting a
> linear line through a cloud of data points. It consists of 3 stages
> --\
> (1) Analyzing the correlation and directionality of the data\
> (2) Estimating the model, i.e., fitting the line, and\
> (3) Evaluating the and usefulness of the model.
>
> **6.3.2 Random Forest**
>
> Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that belongs to
> the supervised learning technique. It can be used for both
> Classification and Regression problems in ML. It is based on the
> concept of ensemble learning, which is a process of combining multiple
> classifiers to solve a complex problem and to improve the performance
> of the model.
>
> As the name suggests, \"Random Forest is a classifier that contains a
> number of decision trees on various subsets of the given dataset and
> takes the average to improve the predictive accuracy of that
> dataset.\" Instead of relying on one decision tree, the random forest
> takes the prediction from each tree and based on the majority votes of
> predictions, and it predicts the final output.

**Fig 6.1:** Working of Random Forest

> The Working process can be explained in the below steps: **Step-1:**
> Select random K data points from the training set.
>
> **Step-2:** Build the decision trees associated with the selected data
> points (Subsets).
>
> **Step-3:** Choose the number N for decision trees that you want to
> build.
>
> **Step-4:** Repeat Step 1 & 2.
>
> **Step-5:** For new data points, find the predictions of each decision
> tree, and assign the new data points to the category that wins the
> majority votes.
>
> **6.3.3 LSTM**\
> Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial(RNN) architecture used

>
> A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output
> gate and a forget gate. The cell remembers values over arbitrary time
> intervals and the three *gates* regulate the flow of information into
> and out of the cell.

> **6.3.4 RNN**

**CONCLUSION AND FUTURE ENHANCEMENT**

> **Conclusion**
>
> The main objective of our dissertation is to develop a more adaptive
> and effective stock prediction system by applying machine learning
> techniques. The survey papers prove the successfully of our proposed
> approach. A systematic prediction tool is developed could be used to
> assist invested make more accurate decision in their stock market
> investment. Our prediction system integrates the stock movement
> forecasting and stock price forecasting.
>
> In addition, numbers of visualization are provided to enhance our
> system. The models using the features from these external sources
> along with the traditional stock market data improve the performance
> for the stock market prediction.
>
> **Future enhancement**\
> In the future, more studies on the use of different algorithms in RSs
> can be done to observe the implications of their use, performance, and
> utility. Moreover, RS development lacks studies analyzing early
> stages, such as requirements and design, and late stages, such as
> maintenance. Open questions in these stages must be investigated to
> improve the knowledge about the field.
